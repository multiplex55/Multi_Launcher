# Track A runtime results

Status: implementation in progress. No optimization checkpoints have completed, and no before/after speedup has been measured.

See `track_a_baseline.md` for the authoritative source and host, and `track_a_checkpoints.md` for checkpoint state, test evidence, review, commit and push outcomes.

## Reporting rules

- Compare the same synthetic fixture, profile, host, warmup and sample protocol.
- Separate production-operation timings from fixture setup, count evidence from wall time, and API submissions from GPU work.
- PASS means the stated command/check actually succeeded. Native checks not performed are NOT RUN.
- Optional M6 work requires measurement evidence; absent evidence does not justify speculative caching.
- Preserve all behavior/data formats and exclude Track B.

## Checkpoint evidence

M0-A verified; M0-B fixtures and workload smoke are in progress.

### M0-A — instrumentation gate

PASS: `cargo nextest run --lib -E 'test(performance::tests)'` on final source: 3 passed, 5,028 skipped. A preceding pass was repeated because final source edits overlapped its compilation. Existing render-test warnings remain. PASS: changed-file `rustfmt --check --edition 2024` and `git diff --check`.

Review: planner owner mapping and parent actual diff inspection; removed unnecessary telemetry forwarding APIs, corrected actual widget construction counts, and made failed index scan outcomes terminal. Fixed atomic storage and opt-in probes cover the required families; definitions are in `track_a_metrics.md`.

No runtime optimization or measured speedup in this checkpoint. Native startup/idle interaction smoke: NOT RUN (headless verification only). Native per-operation counters compile on this Windows host; compilation is not a native behavior pass.

M0-A commit: `193b300c8fd2704e565a38e0928122201c7ada1b`. Ordinary `git push -u origin performance-optimization` FAILED: credential helper authentication prompt was canceled and Git could not read a GitHub username in the noninteractive execution context. No remote success is claimed. Read-only remote access had succeeded earlier. This attempt predates the local-only instruction below.

User steering: checkpoint commits are LOCAL ONLY from this point forward. Do not retry pushes or create an upstream. The user explicitly replaced the original push cadence on October 9, 2026. Preserve the recorded first failed attempt as historical evidence.

### M0-B — deterministic workload gate

PASS: `cargo nextest run --lib -E 'test(track_a_fixture)'` (1 test). Small-mode, serial opt-in owner harnesses passed for notes, history, root list/grid, Quick Notes, changed/unchanged Actions reload and actual index traversal. The five passing owners were retained when the isolated Quick Notes setup correction was verified with its exact test filter. PASS: unprofiled `gui::note_panel::tests::backlink_rows_ignore_fenced_code_links` (1 test), changed-file rustfmt and `git diff --check`.

Independent review resolved unrelated native hotkey startup, dashboard background-work overlap and missing actual rendered-row identity receipts. Test-only inert plugin construction, explicit disabled plugins/hotkeys and startup completion barriers isolate the workload. Disabled gesture state retains an idle watcher on its absolute temporary target; the fixture never creates or changes that target, and each owner runs in its own Nextest process. No native behavior pass is claimed.

Fixture smoke corrections preserved production pin identity semantics and installed Quick Notes synthetic cache after app initialization. Metrics distinguish iterator-next calls from completed scans. Small reload smoke observed 20 logical scans/40 next calls for 16 indexed files on changed payloads, and zero scans on unchanged payloads. These are functional smoke counts, not the frozen full-size baseline or a speedup claim. Full serial measurements follow in M0-C.
